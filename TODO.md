# 🔵 [WIP] B1: Parse multiline python3 -c in BLOCK PLAN and prevent RUN_BLOCK closing-fence concatenation — *Implement multiline python3 -c analysis and trailing fence guard*

- In src/safety.py (summarize_script_actions and scan_script_risks), detect single-line and multiline python3 -c '...' / "..." invocations, analyze their body via _analyze_python_ast, and report them as a [python] operation instead of per-line [exec] items.
- Investigate and harden src/rules/blocks/bash.md and runner handling against LLM omitting the newline between RUN_BLOCK and the closing Markdown fence (which causes CommonMark to leave the code fence open).

# 🎯 [NEXT] F11: Recursive step directory layout and intermediate sub-blocks (e.g. s28/8.1)

- Store each step in its own directory (`<session>/<step>/block.sh`, `out.txt`) so every step (top-level, intermediate sub-step, or fix) shares a uniform recursive structure.
- Support intermediate sub-blocks after an executed step `<N>` before `<N+1>` (e.g. `s28/8.1` -> `s28/8/1/`, `s28/8.1.1` -> `s28/8/1/1/`) and nested fixes (`fix_1/`), so an already-emitted `<session>/<N+1>` block in chat remains valid without reprinting.
