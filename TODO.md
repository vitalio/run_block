# 🎯 [NEXT] F11: Recursive step directory layout and intermediate sub-blocks (e.g. s28/8.1)

- Store each step in its own directory (`<session>/<step>/block.sh`, `out.txt`) so every step (top-level, intermediate sub-step, or fix) shares a uniform recursive structure.
- Support intermediate sub-blocks after an executed step `<N>` before `<N+1>` (e.g. `s28/8.1` -> `s28/8/1/`, `s28/8.1.1` -> `s28/8/1/1/`) and nested fixes (`fix_1/`), so an already-emitted `<session>/<N+1>` block in chat remains valid without reprinting.
