## Archive

### ✅ [DONE] F1: Native PowerShell (`pwsh`) block execution mode on Windows — *15f24a8*

Allow `shell = pwsh` in `~/.config/run_block/config` so Windows users in PowerShell 7
can execute native PowerShell blocks in addition to Bash blocks.

### ✅ [DONE] F2: Custom user-defined safety rules in config — *15f24a8*

Allow adding custom regex patterns or overriding risk categories in
`~/.config/run_block/config`.

### ✅ [DONE] F3: Session cleanup command (`--clean`) — *15f24a8*

Add `run_block --clean [--keep N | --all]` to prune old session directories in
`/tmp/run_block`.

### ✅ [DONE] F4: Smart budget-aware repository map (--tree) — *15f24a8*

Add `run_block --tree` (usable in `.run_block.start` as `$ run_block --tree`) to generate a compact, token-budgeted repository file tree (respecting `.gitignore`, showing line counts for source files, and collapsing large directories into summaries instead of dumping thousands of paths).
